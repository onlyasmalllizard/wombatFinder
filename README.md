# wombatFinder
This is a website that uses Google's Custom Search API to gather image urls from a search for "wombat". It stores them in a database and feeds them at random into an image tag. The user can interact with the site via two buttons, "New wombat" and "Not a wombat". If the user selects "New wombat, a new url is selected. If the user selects "Not a wombat", the entry for that url is edited to reflect that it should not be shown again.

This is not currently hosted anywhere, but a demo video can be viewed [here](https://youtu.be/MaPHHUrxevc).
